With the opening of a new studio we need to look at the trends for movies that are doing well and learning on what they should do but also capitalising the situations where the movie industry is not doing so well. This will be done in helping the microsoft detrmine the types of movies to be produced.


## Business understanding

### Business Problem

Microsoft wants to start in their own original content and want to get a studio to make their own movies etc. They want to use the data they have to choose what direction of film making they want to go to. 

### Aim
Using the data we have we use it to get the genre's and types that are successful ine the market for film is based on the consumer wants. Here we find the type of films and the direction Microsoft should go with. This will hopefully make the business be succesful once its began.

## Data Understanding And Analysis

### The Data
the dataset used for this analysis was downloaded from:
* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)


and was stored  In the folder `zippedData`  
This data contains the different forms/ types of movies and their genres with corrresponding data on their ratings and also how they performed finnacially with correspomding budgets. 


### Data Preparation

The data was checked for missing values and based on their significance in the data they were either deleted completely or they were replaced with new data based on the percentage of their data that is null.Data was checked for duplicates and the data dealt with. Some of the column types also had issues and they sometimes needed for the values to be adjusted for example is the changing the data types of the values.

## Data visualisation

As you can see there seems to be a great number of movies that are superhero or comics related and some seem to appear many times as a movie series  or a sequel.
### CONCLUSION

* Superhero/comics seem to have a good percentage in the nop 10 most earned movies 

* Movie series have the potential to skypocked due to the already established fanbase

* The more you spend the better the quality and the better the gross income


### Recomendations
* Comics/ suprhero movies should be a priority

* I reccomend buyin the rights to an existing comic book with an established fanbase and convert it into film.

* I recomend if you start a movie have a long term plan with many series of movies.

* I recomend also to as Microsoft is a big company that they have a big budget for quality perposes with good writers and directors.
